                juggling, partner acrobatics, and unicycle, among others. I have been involved in a number of shows in
                notable venues across Washington such as the Paramount Theater, Teatro Zinzanni, the Triple Door,
                Broadway Performance Hall, and Emerald City Trapeze.</p>
