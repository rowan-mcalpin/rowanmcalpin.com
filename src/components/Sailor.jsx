            <h3>SAILOR</h3>
            <p>I am a volunteer at the Center for Wooden Boats, where I help run the livery program, as well as operate
                safety boats and help people on the water. Additionally, I am a deckhand aboard Schooner Martha, a
                wooden schooner built in 1907. We train youth in sailing and traditional marine navigation aboard the
                oldest wooden schooner on the West coast. I have recently joined the nonprofit marine search & rescue
                organization Salish Rescue, where I am currently learning more about small boat driving, as well as
                search and rescue operations on the water. </p>
